message: "Ethereum (ETH) is an innovative blockchain network, that shown in 2015, which used as a cryptocurrency. It has the second premier market capitalization of all the cryptocurrencies, though itâ€™s a distant second to Bitcoin which is 19 times much wider.. Whilst Bitcoin was developed as a currency, to be used like regular funds, Ethereum is on top of that a platform and programming language that can be used to build and run applications on. As such, Ethereum has different aims. \r\n \r\nMiners, who give computing power either towards the creation of new blocks or the processing of transactions, are paid with new crypto-tokens called ether. Ether can be traded and used to run applications. As a tradable device, Ethereum has done well and has grown into the biggest altcoin on the market. Ethereum units can be bought or sold against other cryptocurrencies or fiat currencies like the USD or the EUR. \r\n \r\n \r\n<a href=http://hexatra.com/ethereum-cfd-uk/> visit this web page link in hexatra.com</a>"
